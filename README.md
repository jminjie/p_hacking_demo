#   Demonstration of p-Hacking
##  by Jordan

p-Hacking is a method used to subvert the guarentees p-values give researchers in single hypothesis testing. This demonstration should illustrate how even given random data points generated from a normal distribution, p-Hacking can make the points appear to be correlated in suggestive "statistically significant" ways.
